# Guindales Emails

Welcome to Guindales Emails. An email list app where you can manage all your contacts.
Feel free to see the live version [here](https://guindales-emails.vercel.app/) or clone the repository and run a local version using the scripts.

## Tech Stack

- Typescript
- Next.js & React
- Redux (RTK and RTK Query)
- Material UI
- Styled-JSX
- MongoDB
- Jest
- Docker

## Coming soon

I recommend having a look at the [MVP Project](https://github.com/DanielMateosLab/guindales-emails/projects/1).
Some of the features that I will implement soon are:

- Fetch all emails results as raw text. This will allow all emails to be copied and pasted in any email service desired.
- Authentication (and multiple user). At the moment the app is a single email list and is obviously not valid for production use.
- Tags: to better classify the emails. Useful to manage complex or huge email lists.
